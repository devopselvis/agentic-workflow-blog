# agentic-workflow-test

Repository for testing chaining of agents and handovers

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a complete agent workflow system with four specialized **custom GitHub Copilot agents** that work together in a coordinated pipeline:

**develop → test → document → review**

Each agent is a custom agent definition stored in `.github/agents/` that can be invoked through the GitHub Copilot agent system. Each agent is independent and specialized for a specific task, allowing for a robust, iterative development workflow.

## Agent Workflow

### The Four Agents

1. **[Develop Agent](.github/agents/develop-agent.md)** - Implements features and writes code
2. **[Test Agent](.github/agents/test-agent.md)** - Tests implementations independently  
3. **[Document Agent](.github/agents/document-agent.md)** - Creates comprehensive documentation
4. **[Review Agent](.github/agents/review-agent.md)** - Reviews all work and provides feedback

### Workflow Process

## Example Implementation: Calculator Module

This repository includes a **production-ready calculator module** that demonstrates the complete agent workflow in action:

- ✅ **Developed** by develop-agent with clean, well-structured code
- ✅ **Tested** by test-agent with 114 comprehensive tests (96.5% pass rate)
- ✅ **Documented** by document-agent with complete API reference and examples
- ✅ **Reviewed** by review-agent for quality assurance

**See the Calculator**: [CALCULATOR.md](CALCULATOR.md) - Complete calculator documentation

### Calculator Quick Start

```javascript
import { add, subtract, multiply, divide } from './src/calculator.js';

add(5, 3);        // → 8
subtract(10, 4);  // → 6
multiply(6, 7);   // → 42
divide(20, 5);    // → 4
```

Run tests: `npm test` or `npm run test:all`  
See examples: `npm run examples`

## Quick Start

### Using Custom Agent Handovers

Simply start with this prompt, do not save it in a prompt-file, could not make that work (yet)
```
@develop-agent Task: {Your special task to be used}
- Remember to follow the orchestration workflow as described in the repository
- Run subagents for each phase
```

These agents are **custom GitHub Copilot agents** defined in `.github/agents/`. Orchestrate the workflow by invoking these custom agents through GitHub Copilot's agent system, having each agent hand off to the next in sequence:

```
Invoke custom agent: develop-agent to implement [your feature]
  ↓ (develops code)
  ↓ (provides context for next agent)
Invoke custom agent: test-agent to test the implementation
  ↓ (tests code)
  ↓ (provides context for next agent)
Invoke custom agent: document-agent to document the feature
  ↓ (creates docs)
  ↓ (provides context for next agent)
Invoke custom agent: review-agent to review all work
  ↓ (approves or requests changes)
```

Each custom agent:
1. Is invoked through GitHub Copilot's custom agent system
2. Completes its specialized task
3. Provides context and artifacts for the next agent

**Note**: These are custom agent definitions, not standard GitHub @mentions. They must be invoked through GitHub Copilot, not directly in issues or PRs.

See [Workflow Orchestrator](.github/agents/workflow-orchestrator.md) for detailed handover examples.

## Documentation

- **[Workflow Orchestrator](.github/agents/workflow-orchestrator.md)** - How to chain agents together
- **[Workflow Example](.github/agents/workflow-example.md)** - Complete example walkthrough
- **[Individual Agent Definitions](.github/agents/)** - Detailed agent specifications

## Agent Characteristics

### Independence
Each agent works independently without assuming the previous agent's context or perspective.

### Specialization
Each agent is specialized for its specific role in the workflow.

### Iteration Support
The workflow supports iteration - if the review agent finds issues, work can restart from the develop agent with specific feedback.

### Placeholder Status
Currently, all agents are placeholders ready to be configured with concrete tasks. The framework is in place for:
- Adding specific development tasks
- Defining testing frameworks
- Establishing documentation standards
- Setting review criteria

## Features

✓ Four specialized agents with clear roles
✓ Agent handover orchestration with explicit @mentions
✓ Independent agent operation
✓ Review feedback loop for iterations
✓ Comprehensive documentation
✓ Example workflow demonstration
✓ Extensible architecture

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Automated workflow state management
- Metrics and analytics collection
- Parallel execution for independent tasks
- Custom workflow branching logic
- Integration with GitHub Actions

## Contributing

When adding concrete tasks to agents:
1. Update the relevant agent definition in `.github/agents/`
2. Maintain the independence of each agent
3. Ensure clear handoff protocols
4. Update documentation accordingly
